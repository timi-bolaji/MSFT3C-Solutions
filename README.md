# MSFT3C SOLUTIONS

Recently, on the 29th of July, 2017, Microsoft organized a coding competition for UNILAG students on [the official msft3c site](https://msft3c.com), wherein competitors had to solve a certain number of challenges and try to get as many points as possible. This repository contains my solutions to those problems.

I am still trying to obtain the actual questions for the problems, and if I am unable to do so, I will reconstruct the questions to the best of my ability, from memory.

Also, it should be noted that the [Strict Credentials](Source%20Code/Strict%20Credentials) problem has not been solved. I hope to find the time to have a good go at solving it soon.
