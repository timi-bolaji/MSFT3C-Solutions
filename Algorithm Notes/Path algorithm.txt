Recursion will be used. (DFS)

use x and y coordinates to represent each point.
Read entire file into multidimensional array

Need to keep track of letter progress.
Keep track of live map for each iteration.

Enter Find(arg MAP) function
if we reach end, return true and update gloval with self map
Check for matches of next letter in x+1,y+1,x-1,y-1 (constraints are boundary and mapped frontier)

if match is found, replace position with + and call self, passing in map
if no match found, return false.

If true is returned from self call, keep on returning true
